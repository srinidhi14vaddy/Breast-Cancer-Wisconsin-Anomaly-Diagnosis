# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Anomaly-Diagnosis

Performed statistical-EDA and normalization analysis on digitized mass images with 10 nuclei features (radius, texture)

Predicted malignant - benign cancer using Logistic, LDA-QDA, KNN, Lasso-Ridge classifiers with 0.89, 0.88, 0.92, 0.96
and 0.97 accuracies respectively along with decision boundaries and ROC curves

Relevant information

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/
